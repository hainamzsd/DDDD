### 8.2 Retention Implementation

#### Automated Retention Tracking

```sql
-- Example retention check query
SELECT id, location_identifier, created_at,
       CURRENT_DATE - DATE(created_at) AS days_old,
       CASE
         WHEN CURRENT_DATE - DATE(created_at) > 3650 THEN 'Due for archival'
         WHEN CURRENT_DATE - DATE(created_at) > 3285 THEN 'Archival in 1 year'
         ELSE 'Within retention period'
       END AS retention_status
FROM survey_locations
WHERE created_at < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '9 years';
```

**Automated Jobs (Future Implementation):**
1. **Daily:** Identify records approaching retention limit (within 6 months)
2. **Weekly:** Generate retention report for compliance officer
3. **Monthly:** Flag records due for archival (10+ years old)
4. **Quarterly:** Execute archival and anonymization procedures

#### Archival Procedures

Per **Circular 07/2012/TT-BNV** (State Archives Regulations):

**Phase 1: Selection (Month 1-2 of new year)**
1. Query all survey records created 10+ years ago
2. Verify data completeness (no missing fields)
3. Generate archival list with record counts

**Phase 2: Export (Month 2-3)**
1. Export selected records to JSON format
2. Include all related data (photos, polygons, metadata)
3. Verify export integrity (checksums)
4. Encrypt export files (AES-256)

**Phase 3: Transfer (Month 3-4)**
1. Transfer encrypted files to State Archives repository
2. Obtain acknowledgment receipt
3. Verify data integrity at destination

**Phase 4: Anonymization (Month 4-5)**
1. Remove personal identifiers from original database:
   - Replace `owner_name` with pseudonym
   - Replace `owner_id_number` with hash
   - Replace `owner_phone` with NULL
2. Retain non-personal data:
   - GPS coordinates (permanent historical record)
   - Land use type
   - Survey date
   - Location identifier (no personal data)
3. Mark records as "Anonymized" with timestamp

**Phase 5: Verification (Month 5-6)**
1. Verify anonymization completed successfully
2. Confirm no personal data remains in anonymized records
3. Update retention tracking table

**Archival Format:**
```json
{
  "export_metadata": {
    "export_date": "2025-01-15",
    "retention_year": 2014,
    "record_count": 1543,
    "exporter": "officer_id_123456789012"
  },
  "surveys": [
    {
      "location_identifier": "01-01-01-000123",
      "owner_name": "Nguyễn Văn A",
      "owner_id_number": "123456789012",
      "gps_latitude": 21.0285,
      "gps_longitude": 105.8542,
      "photos": ["base64_encoded_photo_1", "..."],
      "...": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 8.3 Secure Deletion Procedures

  -- Step 1: Overwrite sensitive fields 3 times
  UPDATE survey_locations SET owner_name = 'XXXXXXXXXX' WHERE id = 'record_id';
  UPDATE survey_locations SET owner_name = '----------' WHERE id = 'record_id';
  UPDATE survey_locations SET owner_name = random_string() WHERE id = 'record_id';

  -- Step 2: Delete record
  DELETE FROM survey_locations WHERE id = 'record_id';

  -- Step 3: Log deletion
  INSERT INTO deletion_audit_log (record_id, deletion_date, deleted_by)
  VALUES ('record_id', NOW(), current_user);
COMMIT;
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ✅ Record no longer appears in application
